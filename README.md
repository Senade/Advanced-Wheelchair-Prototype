# Advanced Wheelchair Prototype

In the world, there are many conditions that cause speech disability and are associated with the inability to move fingers, numbness, tingling or the inability to grip. Examples of such conditions include Parkinsonâ€™s disease, CREST syndrome, Multiple Sclerosis and Peripheral Neuropathy. The current generation of conventional wheelchairs that make use of a joystick for wheelchair movement, do not cater to the needs of patients with such disabilities. 

As a solution to such a problem, I propose an Advanced Wheelchair concept with the following features:

- **_Hand Gesture Based Locomotion_**: Allows the user to control the movement of the wheelchair using hand gestures. 

-	**_Hand Gesture Based Speech Conversion:_** Allows the speech-disabled to communicate with everybody using hand gestures.

-	**_Geolocation tracking:_** A guardian can have real-time access to the location information of the wheelchair user.

-	**_Heart rate monitoring:_** A guardian can have real-time access to the heart rate information of the wheelchair user.

-	**_Chat Application:_** This feature allows the guardian the wheelchair user to send messages to each other without accessing other messaging applications.

  ###I will add more details and documentation shortly!
